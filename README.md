# fast_learn_algorithm
Fast learning algorithm for all machine learning models, especially neural networks.
The reason that I wanna design this algorithm is that, I thought our machine learning models learns toooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo slowly.
while, HUMAN INTELLIGENCE DOSE NOT!
Principles are:

1. I hope the algorithm learns a sample and remember it FOREVER.

2. When a new sample comes in, she COMPREHENDs it without breaking the learned knowledge system. Which means, memory should not be covered in any case.

3. If contradiction occurs, both knowledge structures should be kept, the knowledge system will be in an ambiguous state, responses are always made with propabilistic math.
